# Fields
Every field element has type `FieldElement`. These are the concrete elements that can be added, multiplied and so on. The operations are delegated to a zero-sized struct implementing the trait `IsField` that defines the operation laws and algorithms used. There are already some basic fields defined.

## How to instantiate a field element for a specific field
```rust
use math::field::element::FieldElement;
use math::field::fields::U64PrimeField;

let x = FieldElement::<U64PrimeField<11>>::from(3);
let y = FieldElement::<U64PrimeField<11>>::from(2);
let z = x + y;
```
Here x, y and z are elements of the field with order 11.

## How to work with general fields
```rust
use math::field::element::FieldElement;
use math::field::traits::IsField;

fn do_something_with_fe<F: IsField>(x: FieldElement<F>) {
    let y = x.pow(3)  + x.pow(2) + x;
    
    // ...
}
```
Here `F` is the Field and `x` is a field element. When further traits are needed for the field element you can specify them using the `where` notation:

```rust
use math::field::element::FieldElement;
use math::field::traits::IsField;

fn do_something_with_fe<F>(x: FieldElement<F>) 
    where
        F: IsField,
        FieldElement<F>: ByteConversion {
    let bytes = x.to_bytes_be();
    
}
```
## How to create a new Field
If you want to create your own field, for example to optimize an operation, you can do that by implementing the `IsField` trait for your own zero-sized struct:

```rust
struct MyCustomField;

impl IsField for MyCustomField {
    type BaseType = u128;

    fn add(a: &Self::BaseType, b: &Self::BaseType) -> Self::BaseType {
        // My optimized algorithm for adding
    }

    // ...
}
```

If we want to create elements of this new field, we can do so by:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = FieldElement::<MyCustomField>::from(3);
    let y = x.pow(3) - x.pow(2) + x;
}
```

As you can see all the operators are already implemented automatically for you.
